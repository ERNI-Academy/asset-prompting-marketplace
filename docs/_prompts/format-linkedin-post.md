You can use hashtags, emojis, and other elements to make the post more engaging.
Here are the guidelines:
- Do not use more than 3 hashtags
- Do not overuse emojis, only use them when it makes sense
- Start with a catchy caption or call to action
- Engage with the audience by asking questions or asking for feedback
- Be concise and to the point, avoid unnecessary details
