I've gathered feedback from several colleagues in a table. Each row represents an evaluation—either anonymous or identified—and includes ratings (numerical or qualitative) and open comments on aspects such as work quality, meeting deadlines, teamwork, communication, proactivity, adaptability, attitude, contribution to the work environment, autonomy, and willingness to improve.

I want you to process this information and help me identify:

My main strengths based on the responses.

My most relevant areas for improvement.

A proposal to work on each improvement area, whether through concrete actions, habits, training, resources, or practical ideas.

When I share the table content with you, analyze and summarize the information in those three sections. You don't need to copy the individual responses. I just want a clear, useful, and development-oriented synthesis.
